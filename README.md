Simple start of app I set up 12 seconds into egghead.io's [Async React with 
Redux Saga](https://egghead.io/courses/async-react-with-redux-saga).

It follows the conventions/patterns of Abramov's egghead.io course [Building 
React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux).

It thus uses thunks instead of sagas, (just a place to start the Saga course), 
but it's 
good if you want to have a look at a very simple idiomatic Redux app.
